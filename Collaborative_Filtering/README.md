# Collaborate Filtering Algorithms

Two quick collaborative filtering algorithms:

collaborative_filter.py expects csv's of different twitter users following
different products/brands

outputs a csv which given a test set, recommends brands back to them

cf.py expects netflix data with user ratings for movies, and gives 
recommendations to users based on collaborative filtering
